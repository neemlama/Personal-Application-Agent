"""propose_form_fill (agent-facing tool) + resume_after_approval
(externally-driven, NOT an agent tool) — the two halves of the human
approval session boundary. Supports two fill_modes:

  "cloud"     — resume_after_approval itself drives fill_and_submit_form
                (AgentCore Browser) synchronously and finalizes the result.
  "extension" — resume_after_approval marks the plan approved and returns;
                a Chrome extension executes the actual DOM fill locally
                (it already has the approved `fields` plan via the session
                GET endpoint) and later reports back through
                record_extension_fill_result, which finalizes the result
                the same way the cloud path does inline. This split exists
                because the backend cannot reach into the user's browser
                tab on its own — only the extension can act there.

propose_form_fill is the actual handoff point: calling it is the
orchestrator declaring "I'm done reasoning, here's exactly what I'd fill
in and submit, a human needs to decide." Nothing after this point runs
autonomously. Treat it as the consequential action it is, not a routine
tool call.

resume_after_approval and record_extension_fill_result are deliberately
NOT decorated with @tool — the agent does not call either on itself. Both
are invoked externally, only after an actual human/extension event.

Known gap, scoped out deliberately rather than silently: if a fill fails
(network blip, page changed, etc.), status lands on "submission_failed"
and stops there — no automatic retry yet. A human would need a manual
follow-up path, not built in this pass.
