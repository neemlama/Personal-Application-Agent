"""log_decision — durable record of every decision the agent (or a human)
makes. This is what turns "autonomous until uncertain" into something
auditable instead of a black box.

Note what this tool is NOT: it doesn't enforce the approval gate — it's a
record of what happened. The actual gate is structural (the orchestrator
stops and returns control to the human before any submission tool runs; see
docs/program-catalog-schema.md and the Phase 3 architecture notes). Logging
happens on both sides of that gate so the trail is complete either way.
